    //////// DATABASE QUERIES:


    /** Opaque handle to a compiled query. */
    typedef struct c4Query C4Query;


    /** Compiles a query from an expression given as JSON. (The current syntax is based
        on Cloudant's, but this is a placeholder and will be changing.)
        The expression is a predicate that describes which documents should be returned.
        A separate, optional sort expression describes the ordering of the results.

        NOTE: Queries are only supported on SQLite-based databases.
        Queries are currently not supported on databases whose documents use revision trees.
        @param database  The database to be queried.
        @param queryExpression  JSON data describing a predicate that documents must match.
                    The syntax is too complex to describe here; see full documentation elsewhere.
        @param sortExpression  Optional JSON array of strings, describing the property path(s)
                    to sort by. The first path is the primary sort, the second secondary, etc.
                    A path can be prefixed with "-" to denote descending order, or "+" (a no-op.)

                    The special path "_id" denotes the document ID, and "_sequence" denotes the
                    sequence number.

                    An empty array suppresses sorting; this is slightly faster, but the order of
                    results is _undefined_ and should be assumed to be randomized.

                    As a convenience, the JSON may be a single string, which is treated as though
                    it were a one-element array. (Of course, it's still JSON, so it must still
                    be enclosed in double-quotes and escaped.)
     
                    If this parameter is left null, results are ordered by document ID.
        @param error  Error will be written here if the function fails.
        @result  A new C4Query, or NULL on failure. */

                bind. Any unbound parameters will be `null`.
