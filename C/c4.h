/** An error value. These are returned by reference from API calls whose last parameter is a
    C4Error*. The semantics are based on Cocoa's usage of NSError:
    * A caller can pass NULL if it doesn't care about the error.
    * The error is filled in only if the function fails, as indicated by its return value
      (e.g. false or NULL.) If the function doesn't fail, it does NOT zero out the error, so its
      contents should be considered uninitialized garbage. */

/** A slice is simply a pointer to a range of bytes, usually interpreted as a UTF-8 string.
    A "null slice" has chars==NULL and length==0.
    A slice with length==0 is not necessarily null; if chars!=NULL it's an empty string.
    A slice as a function parameter is read-only: the function will not alter or free the bytes.
    A slice _returned from_ a function points to newly-allocated memory and must be freed via
    c4slice_free. */
